# Forecasting-solar-panel-performance-using-machine-learning-algorithms
This project aimed to build an accurate and optimum machine-learning model to forecast the performance of a solar panel operating under various design parameters.
Six regressive machine learning algorithms - artificial neural network (ANN), regression trees (RT), an ensemble of RTs, Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector machines (SVM), and the popular linear regression (LR) models were built to find which model best learned the hidden trends in the massive dataset.
The parameters that exerted the strongest influences (as obtained from sensitivity analysis reported in the literature) were selected as the model's features. The target parameters were system power, efficiency, and carbon dioxide emission. 
The dataset is provided for you to play with.
The manuscript resulting from this work is under review in the tope 1% of Energy journals. 
Have fun!
